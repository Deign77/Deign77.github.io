                    Hi, I'm David and I love solving problems with code. My first experience with programming was almost 2 years ago and ever since then I've been spending every spare minute learning, practicing and improving my skills and knowledge.
                    <span id="dots"></span>
                    <span id="more"> <br /><br />                       
                        I've always wanted to start a career doing something that I was passionate about but never found anything that really resonated with me until I discovered programming. My first experience was learning the basics of Python and I found it fascinating, 
                        almost like a game or a puzzle. I knew then that I wanted to become a developer.<br />
                        Initially I learned some basic fundamentals from tutorials, then gradually began doing more and more independent research for more advanced concepts. I started doing coding challenges on sites like Hackerrank and CodeWars and learned a lot from doing so.
                        Eventually I started writing my own projects and to date have completed several of them as can be seen above. 
                     <br /><br />
                    When I'm not programming I enjoy reading, cooking, working out and playing computer games.
