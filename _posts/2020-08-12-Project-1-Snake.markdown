description: This was one of my first projects using Windows Forms. Before starting this project I'd checked out a couple of snake tutorials but the finished products were very basic and rudimentary, with none of the features of the snake games I remember playing as a kid. So I decided to make my own version starting from scratch. Just for fun, I ended up adding a few extra features that weren't included in the old Nokia version.
